# Pseudo-Arclength Continuation Example

This repository contains a Python script (`arclength_continuation.py`) that demonstrates how to use Newtonâ€™s method in conjunction with a pseudo-arclength continuation technique to find points on the unit circle. This approach also illustrates how pseudo-arclength continuation can handle singular points where naive continuation might fail.

Example usage:
```shell
python arclength_continuation.py -d -0.2 -n 30 -t 1e-9 --no-predictor
```
